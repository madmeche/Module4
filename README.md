# Module4
/*Exercise 1 :
Modify the function so that you can pass the content
for the card dynamically.

Exercise 2 :
Modify the code so that your cards are automatically
generated based on data from an array. This way you
will create as many cards as you need to display all the
data in the array.

Exercise 3 - the artist’s portfolio:
Generate multiple templates and populate the page
dynamically. Create profile card and generate cards
representing an artist's portfolio.

For exercise 2 use the following array :

const data = [{name: 'bob', age: 23}, {name: 'alice', age: 39}]

For exercise 3 use the following:

const artist={
name:"Van Gogh",
portfolio:[
{title:"portrait",

url:"https://collectionapi.metmuseum.org/api/collecti
on/v1/iiif/436532/1671316/main-image"},

{title:"sky",

Lab3:  Let's Make a Calculator (pg 38)
In this exercise you will need to create a
calculator. a
Requirements
The application takes 2 numbers, and can
do 4 operations (+,/ , x , -) . You need to
press the equal button to get the result
displayed, and reset to clear it.
1) List the requirements, in this case you have a total of 4
requirements
a) Get data
b) Choose an operator
c) Get the result
d) Reset the screen
2) Sketch the application, so that you are sure about the correct
functioning.
3) You may use a flow diagram to help.
4) Use a tool of your choice, like Figma, to design the application.
5) Use the prototype ability and test it.
Develop the application . Start from GIT ,it is good practice to do things
in a standard way.
- Create a repository
- Clone the repository locally
- Create a branch for each feature
